      <p>
        Thank you for checking out this repo, my name is Igor
        Korman and I am a recent graduate of the Columbia university coding
        bootcamp. As an aspiring web developer I love to indulge in challenges
        including, excluding code and anything in between. Feel free to look
        around and check out the code, in this iteration of my portfolio React
        was used and deployed on git-hub pages. This portfolio features many
        different projects that I have personally worked on throughout class and
        some where I worked with a group. In all group orjects a highlight will
        be added on what exactly was worked on by me. Please feel free to leave
        some comments on the repo or contact me using the contact tab below,
        Enjoy!!
      </p>
