## Introduction

Hello there!

Thank you for checking out this repo, my name is Igor Korman and I am a recent graduate of the Columbia university coding bootcamp. As an aspiring web developer I love to indulge in challenges including, excluding code and anything in between.

Feel free to look around and check out the code, in this iteration of my portfolio React was used and deployed on git-hub pages. This portfolio features many different projects that I have personally worked on throughout class and some where I worked with a group. In all group orjects a highlight will be added on what exactly was worked on by me.

Please feel free to leave some comments on the repo or contact me using the contact tab below, Enjoy!!
